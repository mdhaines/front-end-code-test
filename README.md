## News Corp Australia - Front End Code Test

*Rev3 2021.07.13*

Build a web page according to the **expected result** image below, creating the appropriate HTML structure, CSS styling and JavaScript interactions.
* **Files** - Modify `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js` to your liking.
* **Images** - All the required images are provided in the `images` folder.
* **Responsive** - The desktop version should exactly match the provided mockup. Feel free to adjust the design to look reasonable on **tablet** and **mobile devices**.
* **Header** - As the user scrolls down the page, the white header strip should persist and stick to the top of the page.
* **Font** -  use whichever fonts you like, default system font or Google fonts.
* **Content** - Use the text from the content.txt file.
* **Slider** - The third section contains a continuous image slider. You may use native JavaScript or a library (eg jQuery) but you must write you own code to develop the interaction and not rely on any other third party plugins.
* Fork a copy of our code to make your changes. When you are happy with your work, merge your changes to your Github account and send us the link for review.
